# Deep_reinforcement_learning_Unity_Tennis
This notebook uses deep reinforcement learning technique - Multuple Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient to solve Unity Tennis environment. The environment is considered solved if the highest score between the two agents (average over 100 episodes) is >0.5. The code is in PyTorch (v0.4) and Python 3.
